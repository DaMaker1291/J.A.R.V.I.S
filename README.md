- **Deep Sight Multimodal Vision:** Real-time screen and webcam analysis with intent understanding using Gemini 2.0
- **Recursive Evolution (Self-Learning):** Autonomous tool creation and skill development
- **Ghost in the Machine (Full OS Mastery):** Kernel-level control of PC and IoT devices
- **Zero-Latency Holographic Sync:** Live data visualization on 3D hologram with dynamic HUD
- Voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
- Task automation and system control
- Web search and information retrieval
- Smart home integration
- Custom command system
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Secure and private (runs locally)
